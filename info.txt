Deepawali 2020: Five Promising Day of Worshipping Truthfulness

Deepawali 2020
The reason behind celebrating the Festival of Light, Diwali or Deepawali is its profound triumph over the Darkness, obscurity over wickedness, and learning over obliviousness marked with much excitement and gusto by the millions of Hindu folk before the advent of winter. It’s detailed and prolonged pooja by the religious enthusiastic where all the houses are lit up with lovely glowing lamps, clay pots, and artistic and colourful rangolis outside the home. Also, bursting sparkling crackers by the jumpy juveniles on the day of New Moon goes beyond the cultural and religious celebration. The festival also marks the end of the financial year of the Hindu business community in India. So, on this day, many businessmen perform Lakshmi puja because according to the folklore it is believed that Goddess Lakshmi emerged from Ksheer Sagar, or the Ocean of milk on Diwali and offered wealth, prosperity and happiness to all humankind in the auspicious day of New year.

This five-day-long festival celebration starts with five main festivals. Let's go and find out which are those auspicious festivals.

Govardhan Puja
The fourth day of festivals is celebrated in the form of Govardhan puja or Vishkarma puja all across India. And in 2020, it is celebrated on 15 November.

Bhai Dooj
The last day of the festival ends with the festival Bhai Dooj or Bhai Beej which is celebrated after Govardhan puja, and this time it is approaching on 16 November 2020.
